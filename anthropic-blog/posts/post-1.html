                </div>

                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>When I set out to redesign my personal website, I wanted to create something that embodied the principles of clarity, simplicity, and thoughtful design. I've always admired Anthropic's approach to design—the way they balance minimalism with warmth, and how their typography and spacing create a sense of calm focus.</p>

                    <h2>Design Principles</h2>
                    <p>I started by identifying the key elements of Anthropic's design language that I wanted to incorporate:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Typography:</strong> Clean, readable fonts with careful attention to hierarchy and spacing</li>
                        <li><strong>Color palette:</strong> Subtle, muted colors with strategic accent colors</li>
                        <li><strong>Whitespace:</strong> Generous spacing that gives content room to breathe</li>
                        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Only including what's necessary, removing distractions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Typography Choices</h2>
                    <p>For the primary font, I chose Inter, a versatile sans-serif typeface designed for computer screens. It offers excellent readability at various sizes while maintaining a clean, modern aesthetic. The font weights provide enough contrast for clear hierarchy without being jarring.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="../images/typography-example.jpg" alt="Typography example showing different sizes and weights of Inter font">
                        <figcaption>Different weights and sizes of Inter create a clear visual hierarchy</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <h2>Color Palette</h2>
                    <p>I adopted a restrained color palette inspired by Anthropic's website:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Primary background: Off-white (#FAFAFA)</li>
                        <li>Text: Deep gray (#1A1A1A) for body text, slightly lighter (#4A4A4A) for secondary text</li>
                        <li>Accents: A muted purple (#6B46C1) for links and highlights</li>
                        <li>Secondary accents: Soft blue (#3182CE) and subtle green (#38A169) for variety</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This palette creates a calm, focused reading environment while providing enough contrast for accessibility.</p>

                    <h2>Layout and Spacing</h2>
                    <p>I used a simple grid system with generous margins and padding. Content is limited to a comfortable reading width (around 680px for text), and sections are clearly delineated with consistent spacing.</p>

                    <p>One principle I borrowed directly from Anthropic's design is the use of subtle dividers and spacing to create visual hierarchy without relying on heavy borders or dramatic color changes.</p>

                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <p>For the technical implementation, I kept things simple:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML5 for structure</li>
                        <li>CSS3 for styling, with custom properties for colors and spacing</li>
                        <li>Minimal JavaScript for interactions</li>
                        <li>Responsive design principles throughout</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>I avoided using heavy frameworks or libraries, focusing instead on clean, semantic HTML and efficient CSS. This keeps the site fast and maintainable.</p>

                    <h2>Results and Lessons</h2>
                    <p>The redesign has been well-received, with visitors commenting on the improved readability and professional feel. Page load times have decreased, and mobile usability metrics have improved significantly.</p>

                    <p>The most important lesson I learned was that restraint is often more challenging—and more rewarding—than complexity. By limiting my palette and focusing on typography and spacing, I created a more cohesive and effective design.</p>

                    <p>I'm continuing to refine the site based on feedback and analytics, but the core principles inspired by Anthropic's design language have proven to be a solid foundation.</p>
